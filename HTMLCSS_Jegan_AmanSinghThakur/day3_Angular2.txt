JavaScript is Hybrid language - Switch available betw OOP and functional programming

Angular is built on OOP but React JS is built on functional programming

Angular 2 is made up of modules and nested modules
Areejeet

/// SERVER
node bootstrapDatabase.js

npm run start

http://localhost:8081/api/verticals

ALL routes in routes.js
////////////

Angular CLI commands read!

app-module.ts @NgModule => Decorator (provides extra functionalities to class)

There is one root node and then other are leaf node which run in parallel

All the html code goes in Component (templateURL) and there is app-root in index.html (By defualt and we can change it !)

It's possible to run React and Angular in parallel as well as 2 angular application running parallel in browser.
body-->app-root

app-root2

If you want to use module a in module b
Steps :
Write Module a in import of b
Write Module b in import of a
Declare Module a in declaration of b

What are entryComponents ?

Do Tutorial Heroes 

One way binding and Two way binding

Shadow DOM : shadow DOM (DOM for input, button) is separate DOM created that is different from DOM created above.

Learn Decorative

Providers ! and diff betw providers in module and providers in component
 
Routing in Angular Routing divides application logically using different urls

app-routing modules routing-outlet router-outlet is updated and reflected !

How to set up multiple level router outlets (For beginner start with one router outlet)

Application bootstraps No need to export (Compiler does it for you). Bootstrap kick starts the application.

bootstrap goes and checks for each module and at the end it encounters router-outlet, anything not found is shown in entry component

Router link vs manual routing (not covered) & Unit testing

:unitId?

Dependence injection Soft dependency and Hard dependency

Services (injectable objects => Creates singleton obejct)

Life cycle hooks ?


Difference between import and injectable : import is static import but in injectable you get the instance of the object.

Providers ?

Use of Rough data in singleton object.

Scoping is done for singleton objects

Directives <=> Component






Singleton object has single instance depending where it is injected. It's possible to have multiple instances of same singleton object depending on scope.

one way databinding - only for presentational : just shown in html page two way databinding - shown in html and its changes are reflected in backend

Anjular JS had 2-way binding but Angular 2 has 1-way and 2-way much more efficient.

ngOnInit(){
}

Activated Route 

Single page application development

code evolution youtube !!


All the data transferred in JSON in angular CLI

@input used to pass data from parent to child

Lifecycles hooks !

ngOnInit calls just after constructor (called only once) & ngOnChanges when data binded changes (called multiple times)

lifecylce angular component

Promises

Angular Pipes !!!!!! Promise and Subscribe Asynchronous calls

Rx-JS

Observables is just a type of tunnel to get your data and rx-js provides operators.
