This Spring MVC project is integrated with Spring JDBC. 
Features :
-> Spring JDBC (RowMapper, Query)
-> Spring MVC (GET, POST)
-> Factory (Factory Method)
Please refer to /getStudent, /getStudents, /getStudent/234, /student in StudentController.java

/student has Form page which posts data to /addstudent. It's stored in Student POJO and inserted into DB using DAL (JDBCTempleDAO).

Get and Posts working but unable to display on page. Please check console.

Thank you !
